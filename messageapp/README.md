# Messaging Application

## Description

This application is aimed at mimicking real life messaging applications as it aids my furthur learning of react concepts.

It is made of a Users chat section and the users messaging section.

The user chat section is made of different user chats displayed on the UI and displays the last texted message by the user and when clicked or touched the UI displays the specific clicked User's recent messages.

### How it works

In order for you to run this application please look-up for the package.json file and install the dependecies for this application.
